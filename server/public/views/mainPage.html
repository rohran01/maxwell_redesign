      <p>
        I grew up in Wautoma, Wisconsin, a town of 2,000 people. I spent my early years reading books, singing songs, painting pictures, and watching movies.</br></br>

        I left home and ventured to the magical land of Minneapolis to pursue a career in art. Four years later, I graduated from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design with a BFA in Filmmaking. While in school, I produced a feature-length musical and started designing at 3M full-time. After my contract ended, I found myself in the Creative Services department of FOX9, doing all the things I love.</br></br>

        I now live in St Paul with my dog, Chewie. In my free time I enjoy reading books, singing songs, painting pictures, and watching movies.</br></br>

        I guess some things never change.</br></br>
